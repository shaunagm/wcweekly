Victoria Woodhull and her sister Tennessee were pioneering feminists in the latter half of the 19th century.

Using money earned as the United States' first female stockbrokers, they began publishing 'Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly', a weekly newspaper advocating women's suffrage, redistribution of wealth, and free love, among other radical ideas.

During the Weekly's run, Woodhull ran for the US Presidency, but was jailed on charges of obscenity during the election.

There is no complete text of Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly online.  The best way to view it is to find a library which holds the journal articles or, more commonly, the microform version of them.

This project is an effort to create scans of the microforms of all issues of the newspaper.  Due to the low quality of the scans, I am also attempting to manually transcribe the newspapers so the text is available in digital format.

To find a microform pdf to transcribe, visit the issue tracker of this repo.
