There seems to be a queer idea among a queer set of people as to what constitutes a free paper.  This class imagines that is can send in manuscript enough every week to fill two papers, and if it is not published, then the paper loses its character of freedom.  It also pretends to think it can write articles fillwed with personal abuse, having no relation whatever to principle, but merely a vent of personal spleen, and if they are not inserted, then the freedom of the paper falls.  We publish such an article this week, in order to illustrate what we mean; we refer to the communication on page 6 relative to Spiritual matters in Springfield, Mass.  In the article to which this pretends to be a reply, there wasn't a line to warrant the personal language of this.  We utterly deprecate all such discussion, and permit this to be published to give formal notice to all whom it may concern, that from this time hence, we shall refuse to permit such articles to appear in the WEEKLY.  This constitutes no part of the meaning of a free paper as understood by us.

This relates specifically and only to the publication of articles which principles, ideas and methods are discussed.  Such articles will always be regarded as entitled to publication, but we cannot promise to insert everybody's writings.  From what we receive we must select such a variety as will, in our judgment, conduce most to the advance of reform, and from such as are treated in the most concise and forcible manner.  Others may pretend to know more about our motives in making selections than we do, but until we are convinced that they do, we shall continue to act as heretofore, even if there must be another paper started to accomodate their injured dignity and immense importance.  It's our opinion that a soldier who will attempt to blow up the arsenal because his plan of conducting the campaign is ignored, is a traitor at heart to the cause.
