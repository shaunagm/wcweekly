THE PRESENT CRISIS. 
</center></b>
<br><br>
When a deed is done for Freedom, through the broad earth&#8217;s aching breast <br>
Runs a thrill of joy prophetic, trembling on from East to West, <br>
And the slave, where&#8217;er he cowers, feels the soul within him climb <br>
To the awful verge of manhood, as the energy sublime <br>
Of a century bursts full-blossomed on the thorny stem of Time. 
<br><br>
Through the walls of hut and palace shoots the instantaneous throe <br>
When the travail of the Ages wrings earth&#8217;s systems to and fro; <br>
At the birth of each new Era, with a recognizing start, <br>
Nation wildly looks at nation, standing with mute lips apart, <br>
And glad Truth&#8217;s yet mightier man-child leaps beneath the Future&#8217;s heart.
<br><br>
For mankind are one in spirit and an instinct bears along, <br>
Round the earth&#8217;s electric circle, the swift flash of right and wrong; <br>
Whether conscious or unconscious, yet Humanity&#8217;s vast frame <br>
Through its ocean-sundered fibres feels the gush of joy or shame; &#8211; <br>
In the gain or loss of one race all the rest have equal claim. 
<br><br>
Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide, <br>
In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side; <br>
Some great cause, God&#8217;s new Messiah, offering each the bloom or blight, <br>
Parts the goats upon the left hand and the sheep upon the right, <br>
And the choice goes by forever twixt that darkness and the light.
<br><br>
Careless seems the great avenger; history&#8217;s pages but record <br>
One death-grapple in the darkness twixt old systems and the Word; <br>
Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne, &#8211; <br>
Yet that scaffold sways the Future, and behind the dim unknown, <br>
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own. 
<br><br>
We see dimly in the Present what is small and what is great, <br>
Slow of faith, how weak an arm may turn the iron helm of fate, <br>
But the soul is still oracular; amid the market&#8217;s din, <br>
List the ominous stern whisper from the Delphic cave within &#8211; <br>
&#8220;They enslave their children&#8217;s children who make compromise with sin.&#8221;
<br><br>
Then to side with Truth is noble, when we share her wretched crust, <br>
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and &#8217;tis prosperous to be just; <br>
When it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside, <br>
Doubting in his abject spirit, till his Lord is crucified, <br>
And the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied. 
<br><br>
Count me o&#8217;er earth&#8217;s chosen heroes &#8211; they were those that stood alone <br>
While the men they agonized for hurled the contumelious stone, <br>
Stood serene, and down the future saw the golden beam incline <br>
To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their faith divine, <br>
By one man&#8217;s plain truth to manhood and to God&#8217;s supreme design. 
<br><br>
For Humanity sweeps onward: where to-day the martyr stands, <br>
On the morrow crouches Judas with the silver in his hands; <br>
Far in front the cross stands ready and the crackling fagots burn, <br>
While the hooting mob of yesterday in silent awe return <br>
To glean up the scattered ashes into History&#8217;s golden urn. 
<br><br>
They have rights who dare maintain them; we are traitors to our sires, <br>
Smothering in their holy ashes Freedom&#8217;s new-lit altar fires;<br>
Shall we make their creed our jailor? Shall we, in our haste to slay, <br>
From the tombs of the old prophets steal the funeral lamps away <br>
To light up the martyr-fagots round the prophets of to-day? 
<br><br>
New occasions teach new duties; Time makes ancient good uncouth; <br>
They must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast of Truth; <br>
So, before us gleam her camp-fires! we ourselves must Pilgrims be, <br>
Launch our Mayflower, and steer boldly through the desperate winter sea, <br>
Nor attempt the Future&#8217;s portal with the Past&#8217;s blood-rusted key.

The Principles of Social Freedom.

It has been said by a very wise person that there is a <i>trinity</i> in all
things, the perfect <i>unity</i> of the trinity or a tri-unity being necessary
to make a complete objective realization. Thus we have the theological Trinity:
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost; or Cause, Effect and the Process of
Evolution. Also the <i>political</i> Trinity: Freedom, Equality, Justice or <i>Individuality,
Unity, Adjustment</i>; the first term of which is also resolvable into these
parts, thus: Religious freedom, political freedom and social freedom, while
Religion, Politics and Socialism are the Tri-unity of Humanity. There are also
the beginning, the end and the intermediate space, time and motion, to all
experiences of space, time and motion, and the diameter, circumference and
area, or length, breadth and depth to all form. 
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.3" id="PSF.3"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.3</b></font></a></td><td>
Attention has been called to these scientific facts, for the purpose of
showing that for any tri-unity to lack one of its terms is for it to be
incomplete; and that in the order of natural evolution, if two terms exist, the
third must also exist. 
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.4" id="PSF.4"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.4</b></font></a></td><td>
Religious freedom does, in a measure, exist in this country, but not yet
perfectly; that is to say, a person is not entirely independent of public
opinion regarding matters of conscience. Though since Political freedom has
existed in theory, every person has the <i>right</i> to entertain any religious
theory he or she may conceive to be true, and government can take no cognizance
thereof &#8211; he is <i>only</i> amenable to <i>society</i>-despotism. The necessary
corollary to Religious and Political freedom is Social freedom, which is the
third term of the trinity; that is to say, if Religious and Political freedom
exist, <i>perfected,</i> Social freedom is at that very moment guaranteed,
since Social freedom is the fruit of that condition.

We find the principle of Individual freedom was quite dormant until it began
to speak against the right of religious despots, to determine what views should
be advocated regarding the relations of the creature to the Creator. Persons
began to find ideas creeping into their souls at variance with the teachings of
the clergy; which ideas became so <i>strongly</i> fixed that they were
compelled to protest against Religious Despotism. Thus, in the sixteenth
century, was begun the battle for Individual freedom. The claim that rulers had
<i>no right</i> to control the consciences of the people was boldly made, and
right nobly did the fight continue until the <i>absolute</i> right to
individual opinion was wrung from the despots, and even the <i>common</i> people
found themselves entitled to not only entertain but also to promulgate <i>any</i> belief
or theory of which they could conceive. 
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.6" id="PSF.6"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.6</b></font></a></td><td>
With yielding the control over the <i>consciences</i> of individuals, the
despots had no thought of giving up any right to their <i>persons</i>. But
Religious freedom naturally led the people to question the right of this
control, and in the eighteenth century a new protest found expression in the
French Revolution, and it was baptized by a deluge of blood yielded by
thousands of lives. But not until an enlightened people freed themselves from
English tyranny was the right to self-government acknowledged in theory, and <i>not
yet</i> even is it fully accorded in practice, as a legitimate result of that
theory. 
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.7" id="PSF.7"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.7</b></font></a></td><td>
It may seem to be a <i>strange</i> proposition to make, that there is no
such thing yet existent in the world as self-government, in its political
aspects. But such is the fact. If self-government be the rule, every self must
be its subject. If a person govern, not only <i>himself</i> but others, that is
despotic government, and it matters not if that control be over one or over a
thousand individuals, or over a nation; in <i>each</i> case it would be the <i>same</i> principle of power exerted outside of self and over others, and <i>this</i> is
despotism, whether it is exercised by <i>one</i> person over his subjects, or
by <i>twenty</i> persons over a nation, or by <i>one-half</i> the people of a
nation over the other half thereof. There is no escaping the fact that the
principle by which the <i>male</i> citizens of these United States assume to
rule the <i>female</i> citizens is <i>not</i> that of self-government, but that
of despotism; and so the fact is that poets have sung songs of freedom, and
anthems of liberty have resounded for an empty shadow.

King George III, and his Parliament denied our forefathers the right to make
their own laws; they rebelled, and being successful, inaugurated this
government. But men do not seem to comprehend that they are now pursuing toward
<i>women</i> the <i>same</i> despotic course that King George pursued toward
the American colonies.

But what is freedom? The press and our male governors are <i>very much</i> exercised
about this question, since a certain set of resolutions were launched upon the
public by Paulina Wright Davis at Apollo Hall, May 12, 1871. They are as
follows: 
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.10" id="PSF.10"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.10</b></font></a></td><td>
<blockquote>
<i>Resolved,</i> That the basis of order is freedom from bondage; not,
indeed, of such &#8220;order&#8221; as resigned in Warsaw, which grew out of the
bondage; but of such order as reigns in Heaven, which grows out of that
developed manhood and womanhood in which each becomes &#8220;a law unto
himself.&#8221;
</blockquote>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.11" id="PSF.11"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.11</b></font></a></td><td>
<blockquote>
<i>Resolved,</i> That freedom is a principle, and that as such it may be
trusted to ultimate in harmonious social results, as in America, it has
resulted in harmonious and beneficent political results; that it has not
hitherto been adequately trusted in the social domain, and that the woman&#8217;s
movement means no less than the complete social as well as the political
enfranchisement of mankind. 
</blockquote>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.12" id="PSF.12"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.12</b></font></a></td><td>
<blockquote>
<i>Resolved,</i> That the evils, sufferings and disabilities of women, as
well as of men, are social still more than they are political, and that a
statement of woman&#8217;s rights which ignores the rights of self-ownership as the
first of all rights is insufficient to meet the demand, and is ceasing to
enlist the enthusiasm and even the common interest of the most intelligent
portion of the community.
</blockquote>
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.13" id="PSF.13"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.13</b></font></a></td><td>
<blockquote>
<i>Resolved,</i> That the principle of freedom is one principle, and not a
collection of many different and unrelated principles; that there is not at
bottom one principle of freedom of conscience as in Protestantism, and another
principle of freedom from slavery as in Abolitionism, another of freedom of
locomotion as in our dispensing in America with the passport system of Europe,
another of the freedom of the press as in Great Britain and America, and still
another of social freedom at large; but that freedom is one and indivisible; and
that slavery is so also; that freedom and bondage or restriction is the
alternative and the issue, alike, in every case; and that if freedom is good in
one case it is good in all; that we in America have builded on freedom,
politically, and that we cannot consistently recoil from that expansion of
freedom which shall make it the basis of all our institutions; and finally,
that so far as we have trusted it, it has proved, in the main, safe and profitable.

Now, is there anything so terrible in the language of these resolutions as
to threaten the foundations of society? They asset that every individual has a <i>better</i> right to herself or himself than any other person <i>can have</i>. No
living soul, who does not desire to have control over, or ownership in, another
person, can have any <i>valid</i> objection to <i>anything</i> expressed in
these resolutions. Those who are not willing to give up control over others;
who desire to <i>own</i> somebody beside themselves; who are constitutionally
predisposed against self-government and the giving of the same freedom to
others that they demand for themselves, will of course object to them, and such
are the people with whom we shall have to contend in this new struggle for a
greater liberty.

Now, the individual <i>is</i> either self-owned and self-possessed or <i>is
not</i> so self-possessed. If he be self-owned, he is so because he has an <i>inherent</i> right to self, which right cannot be delegated to any second person; a
right &#8211; as the American Declaration of Independence has it &#8211; which is
&#8220;inalienable.&#8221; The individual must be responsible to self and God for
his acts. If he be owned and possessed by some second person, then there is <i>no
such thing</i> as individuality: and that for which the world has been striving
these thousands of years is the merest myth.

But against this irrational, illogical, inconsequent and irreverent theory I
boldly oppose the spirit of the age &#8211; that spirit which will <i>not</i> admit all
civilization to be a failure, and all past experience to count for nothing;
against that demagogism, I oppose the plain principle of freedom in its <i>fullest,
purest, broadest, deepest</i> application and significance &#8211; the freedom which we
see exemplified in the starry firmament, where whirl innumerable worlds, and
never one of which is made to lose its individuality, but each performs its
part in the grand economy of the universe, giving and receiving its natural
repulsions and attractions; we also see it exemplified in every department of
nature about us: in the sunbeam and the dewdrop; in the storm-cloud and the
spring shower; in the driving snow and the congealing rain &#8211; all of which speak
more eloquently than can human tongue of the heavenly <i>beauty, symmetry</i> and
<i>purity</i> of the spirit of freedom which in them reigns untrammeled. 
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.17" id="PSF.17"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.17</b></font></a></td><td>
Our government is based upon the proposition that: All men and women are
born free and equal and entitled to certain inalienable rights, among which are
life, liberty and the <i>pursuit</i> of happiness. Now what we, who demand
social freedom, ask, is simply that the government of this country shall be
administered in accordance with the spirit of this proposition. <i>Nothing</i> more,
<i>nothing</i> less. If that proposition mean <i>anything</i>, it means <i>just
what</i> it says, without qualification, limitation or equivocation. It means
that <i>every</i> person who comes into the world of outward existence is of <i>equal</i> right as an individual, and is free as an individual, and that he or she is
entitled to pursue <i>happiness</i> in whatever direction he or she may choose.
Now this is absolutely true of all men and all women. But just here the
wise-acres stop and tell us that <i>everybody</i> must <i>not</i> pursue
happiness in his or her own way; since to do so absolutely, would be to have no
protection against the action of individuals. These good and well-meaning people
only see <i>one-half</i> of what is involved in the proposition. They look at a
single individual and for the time lose sight of all others. They do not take
into their consideration that every other individual beside the one whom they
contemplate is <i>equally</i> with him entitled to the <i>same</i> freedom; and
that each is free within the area of his or her individual sphere; and <i>not</i> free
within the sphere of any other individual whatever. They do not seem to
recognize the fact that the moment one person gets out of <i>his</i> sphere
into the sphere of <i>another</i>, that other must protect him or herself
against such invasion of rights. They do not seem to be able to comprehend that
the moment one person encroaches upon another person&#8217;s rights he or she ceases
to be a <i>free</i> man or woman and becomes a <i>despot</i>.  To all such
persons we assert: that it is <i>freedom</i> and <i>not</i> despotism which we
advocate and demand; and we will as rigorously demand that individuals be
restricted to <i>their</i> freedom as any person dare to demand; and as
rigorously demand that people who are predisposed to be <i>tyrants</i> instead
of free men or women shall, by the government, be so restrained as to make the
exercise of their proclivities impossible.

If life, liberty ad the pursuit of happiness are <i>inalienable</i> rights
in the individual, and government is based upon that inalienability, then it <i>must
follow</i> as a <i>legitimate</i> sequence that the <i>functions</i> of that
government are to <i>guard</i> and <i>protect</i> the right to life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness, to the end that <i>every</i> person may have the most
<i>perfect</i> exercise of them. And the most perfect exercise of such rights
is <i>only</i> attained when every individual is not only fully <i>protected</i> in
his rights, but also <i>strictly restrained</i> to the exercise of them within
his <i>own</i> sphere, and <i>positively</i> prevented from proceeding beyond
its limits, so as to encroach upon the sphere of another: unless that other
first <i>agree</i> thereto.

These propositions are all self-evident, and must be accepted by every
person who subscribes to our theory of government, based upon the sovereignty
of the individual; consequently any law in force which conflicts with any of
them is not in accord with that theory and is therefore unconstitutional. 
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.27" id="PSF.27"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.27</b></font></a></td><td>
A fatal error into which most people fall, is, that rights are conceded to
governments, while they are only possessed of the right to perform duties, as a
farther analysis will show: 
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.28" id="PSF.28"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.28</b></font></a></td><td>
In the absence of any arrangement by the members of a community to secure
order, <i>each</i> individual is a law unto himself, so far as he is capable of
maintaining it against all other individuals; but at the mercy of all such who
are bent on conquest. Such a condition is anarchy. 
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a name="PSF.29" id="PSF.29"><font color="gray" size="-1"><b>PSF.29</b></font></a></td><td>
But if in individual freedom the <i>whole</i> number of individuals unite to
secure <i>equality</i> and protection to themselves, they thereby surrender <i>no</i> individual rights to the community, but they simply <i>invest</i> the
community with the power to perform certain specified <i>duties,</i> which are
set forth in the law of their combination. Hence a government erected by the
people is invested, <i>not</i> with the <i>rights</i> of the people, but with
the <i>duty</i> of <i>protecting</i> and maintaining their rights <i>intact</i>; and
any government is a <i>failure</i> or a <i>success</i> just so far as it fails
or succeeds in this duty; and these are the legitimate functions of government.

I have before said that every person has the right to, and can, determine
for himself what he will do, even to taking the life of another. But it is <i>equally</i> true that the attacked person has the right to defend his life against such
assault. If the person succeed in taking the life, he thereby demonstrates that
he is a <i>tyrant</i> who is at all times liable to invade the right to life,
and that every individual of the community is put in jeopardy by the freedom of
this person. Hence it is the <i>duty</i> of the government to so restrict the
freedom of this person as to make it <i>impossible</i> for him to ever again
practice such tyranny. Here the duty of the community ceases. It has <i>no</i> right
to take the life of the individual. That is his own, <i>inalienably</i> vested
in him, both by <i>God</i> and the <i>Constitution</i>.

A person may also appropriate the property of another if he so choose, and there
is no way to prevent it; but once having thus invaded the rights of another,
the whole community is in danger from the propensity of this person. It is
therefore the duty of government to so restrain the liberty of the person as to
prevent him from invading the spheres of other persons in a manner against
which he himself demands, and is entitled to, protection.

The same rule applies to that class of persons who have a propensity to
steal or to destroy the character of others. This class of encroachers upon
others&#8217; rights, in some senses, are <i>more</i> reprehensible than any other,
save only those who invade the rights of life; since for persons to be made to
appear what they are not may, perhaps, be to place them in such relations with
third persons as to destroy their means of pursuing happiness. Those who thus
invade the pursuit of happiness by others, should be held to be the <i>worst</i> enemies
of society; proportionably worse than the common burglar or thief, as what they
destroy is more valuable than is that which the burglar or thief can
appropriate. For robbery there may be <i>some</i> excuse, since what is stolen
may be required to contribute to actual needs; but that which the assassin of
character appropriates does <i>neither</i> good to himself nor to <i>any one
else</i>, and makes the loser poor indeed. Such persons are the worst enemies
of society.

I have been thus explicit in the analysis of the principles of freedom in
their application to the common affairs of life, because I desired, before
approaching the main subject, to have it <i>well settled</i> as to what may
justly be considered the rights of individuals; or in other words what
individual sovereignty implies.

thing, if the government of the United States were to pass a law compelling
persons to adhere during life to everything they should to-day accept as their
religion, their politics and their vocations. It would <i>manifestly</i> be a
departure from the true functions of government. The apology for what I claim
to be an invasion of the rights of the individual is found in the law to
enforce contracts. While the enforcement of contracts in which <i>pecuniary</i> considerations
are involved is a matter distinct and different from that of the enforcement of
contracts involving the happiness of individuals, <i>even in them</i> the
governments has <i>no</i> legitimate right to interfere. The logical deduction
of the right of two people to <i>make</i> a contract without consulting the
government, or any third party, is the right of <i>either or both</i> of the
parties to <i>withdraw</i> without consulting any third party, either in
reference to its enforcement or as to damages.

As has been stated, such an arrangement is the result of the exercise of the
right of two or more individuals to unite their rights, perfectly independent
of every outside party. There is neither right nor duty beyond the uniting &#8211; the

settle any difference which may arise between such parties. All such contracts
have their legitimate basis and security in the honor and purposes of the
contracting parties. It seems to me that, admitting our theory of government,
no proposition can be plainer than is this, notwithstanding the practice is
entirely different. But I am now discussing the abstract principles of the

In all general contracts, people have the protection of government in
contracting for an hour, a <i>day</i>, a <i>week</i>, a <i>year</i>, a <i>decade</i>,
or a life, and <i>neither</i> the government nor <i>any other third</i> party
<i>or</i> persons, or <i>aggregates</i> of persons ever <i>think</i> of making
a scale of respectability, graduated by the length of time for which the
contracts are made and maintained. <i>Least of all</i> does the government
require that any of these contracts shall be entered into for life. Why should
the social relations of the sexes be made subject to a different theory? All
enacted laws that are for the purpose of perpetuating conditions which are
themselves the results of evolution are so many obstructions in the path of

stops. &#8220;Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther,&#8221; is <i>not</i> the

law made to determine what individual cases demand, since a variety of
conditions cannot be subject to one and the same rule of operation. Here we
arrive at the most important of all facts relating to human needs and

I think it will be generally conceded that without love there should be no
marriage. In the constitution of things <i>nothing</i> can be more certain.
This basic fact is fatal to the theory of marriage for life: since if love is
what <i>determines</i> marriage, so, also, should it determine its continuance.
If it be primarily right of men and women to take on the marriage relation of
their own free will and accord, <i>so</i>, too, does it remain their right to
determine <i>how</i> long it shall continue and when it shall cease. But to be
respectable (?) people must comply with the law, and thousands do comply
therewith, while in their hearts they protest against it as an unwarrantable
interference and proscription of their rights. Marriage laws that would be
consistent with the theory of individual rights would be such as would <i>regulate</i> these relations, such as regulate <i>all other</i> associations of people.
They should only be obliged to file marriage articles, containing whatever
provisions may be agreed upon, as to their personal rights, rights of property,
of children, or whatever else they may deem proper for them to agree upon. And
whatever these articles might be, they should in all cases be equally entitled
to public respect and protection. Should separation afterward come, nothing
more should be required than the simple filing of counter articles.

But, says another objector, though the repeal of marriage laws might operate
well enough in all those cases where a <i>mutual</i> love or hate would

I assume, in the first place, when there is not mutual love there is no
union to continue and nothing to justify, and it has already been determined
that, as marriage should have love as a basis, if love depart marriage also
departs. But laying this aside, see if there can any real good or happiness
possibly result from an enforced continuance of marriage upon the part of one
party thereto. Let all persons take this question home to their own souls, and
there determine if they could find happiness in holding unwilling hearts in
bondage. It is <i>against</i> the <i>nature of things</i> that any satisfaction
can result from such a state of things except it be the satisfaction of knowing
that you have succeeded in virtually imprisoning the person whom you <i>profess</i>

Again, it must be remembered that the individual affairs of two persons are
not the subject of interference by any third party, and if one of them choose to
separate, there is no power outside of the two which can rightly interfere to
prevent. Beside, who is to determine whether there will be more happiness
sacrificed by a <i>continuation</i> or a <i>separation</i>? If a person is 
<i>fully</i> determined to separate, it is proof positive that another feeling <i>stronger</i>
than all his or her sentiments of duty determine it. And here, again, <i>who</i>
but the individual is to determine which course will secure the most good?
Suppose that a separation is desired because one of the two loves and is loved
elsewhere. In this case, if the union be maintained by force, at least <i>two</i> of
three, and, probably, <i>all three</i> persons will be made unhappy thereby;
whereas if separation come and the other union be consummated, there will be
but one, unhappy. So even here, if the greatest good of the greatest number is
to rule, separation is not only legitimate, <i>but</i> desirable. In all other
things except marriage it is always held to be the right thing to do to <i>break
a bad bargain or promise</i> just as soon as possible, and I hold that of <i>all

The tenth commandment of the Decalogue says: &#8220;Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor&#8217;s wife.&#8221; And Jesus, in the beautiful parable of the Samaritan who
fell among thieves, asks: &#8220;Who is thy neighbor?&#8221; and answers his own
question in a way to lift the conception wholly out of the category of mere
local proximity into a sublime spiritual conception. In other words, he
spiritualizes the word and sublimates the morality of the commandment. In the
same spirit I ask now, Who is a <i>wife?</i> And I answer, not the woman who,
ignorant of her own feelings, or with lying lips, has promised, in hollow

We know positively that Jesus would have answered in that way. He has
defined for us &#8220;the neighbor,&#8221; not in the paltry and commonplace
sense, but spiritually. He has said, &#8220;He that looketh on a woman to lust
after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.&#8221; So,
therefore, he spiritualized the idea of adultery. In the kingdom of heaven, to
be prayed for daily, to come on earth, there is to be no &#8220;marrying or

marriage must always exist, and had Jesus been called on to define a wife, can
anybody doubt that he would, in the same spirit, the spiritualizing tendency

To speak thus plainly and pointedly is a <i>duty I owe</i> to myself. The
press have stigmatized me to the world as an advocate, theoretically and

stamp of moral deformity; the vulgar and inconsequent definition which they
hold makes the theory an abomination. And though this conclusion is a no more
legitimate and reasonable one than that would be which should call the Golden
Rule a general license to all sorts of debauch, since Free Love bears the <i>same</i>
relations to the moral deformities of which it stands accused as does the
Golden Rule to the Law of the Despot, yet it obtains among many intelligent
people. But they claim, in the language of one of these exponents, that
&#8220;Words belong to the people; they are the common property of the mob. Now
the common use, among the mob, of the term Free Love, is a synonym for
promiscuity.&#8221; Against this absurd proposition I oppose the assertion that
words <i>do not</i> belong to the mob, but to that which they represent. Words
are the exponents and interpretations of ideas. If I use a word which exactly
interprets and represents what I would be understood to mean, shall I go to the
<i>mob</i> and <i>ask of them</i> what interpretation <i>they</i> choose to
place upon it? If lexicographers, when they prepare their dictionaries, were to
go to the mob for the rendition of words, what kind of language would we have?

should be used to convey, their united definitions, the mob to the contrary
notwithstanding. And when the term Free Love finds a place in dictionaries, it
will prove my claim to have been correct, and that the mob have not received

that <i>no</i> other person had any right to her favor, and that she had no

to give him up to her, to whom he evidently desired to go, and where, following

I have a better right to speak, as one having authority in this matter, than
most of you have, since it has been my province to study it in all its various
lights and shades. When I practiced clairvoyance, <i>hundreds</i>, aye thousands,
of desolate, heart-broken men, as well as women, came to me for advice. And
they were from all walks of life, from the humblest daily laborer to the
haughtiest dame of wealth. The tales of horror, of wrongs in inflicted and
endured, which were poured into my ears, first awakened me to a realization of
the hollowness and the rottenness of society, and compelled me to consider
whether laws which were prolific of so <i>much</i> crime and misery as I found
to exist should be continued; and to ask the question whether it were not <i>better</i>
to let the bond go free. In time I was fully convinced that marriage laws
were productive of precisely the <i>reverse</i> of that for which they are
supposed to have been framed, and I came to recommend the grant of entire
freedom to those who were complained of an inconstant; and the frank asking for
it by those who desired it. My <i>invariable</i> advice was: &#8220;Withdraw
lovingly, but completely, all claim and all complaint as an injured and
deserted husband or wife. You need not perhaps disguise the fact that you
suffer keenly from it, but take on yourself all the fault that you have not
been able to command a more continuous love; that you have not proved to be 
<i>all</i> that you once seemed to be. Show magnanimity, and in order to <i>show</i> it,
try to <i>feel</i> it. Cultivate that kind of love which loves the happiness
and well-being of your partner <i>most</i>, his or her person next, and
yourself last. Be kind to, and sympathize with, the new attraction rather than

Some may indeed think if I can keep the <i>semblance</i> of a husband or
wife, even if it be not a lover, <i>better still</i> that it be so. Such is not
my philosophy or my faith, and for such I have no advice to give. I address
myself to such as have <i>souls</i>, and whose souls are in question; if you

seen a <i>few</i> instances of the most magnanimous action among the persons
involved in a knot of love, and with the most angelic results. I believe that
the love which goes forth to bless, and if it be to <i>surrender</i> in order
to bless, is love in the <i>true</i> sense, and that it tends greatly to beget
love, and that the love which is demanding, thinking only of self, is not love.

I have learned that the first <i>great</i> error married people commit is in
endeavoring to <i>hide</i> from each other the little irregularities into which
all are liable to fall. <i>Nothing</i> is so conducive to continuous happiness
as mutual confidence. In <i>whom</i>, if not in the husband or the wife, should
[be] one confide? Should they not be each other&#8217;s <i>best</i> friends, <i>never</i> failing
in time of anxiety, trouble and temptation to give disinterested and unselfish
counsel? From such a perfect confidence as I would have men and women
cultivate, it is <i>impossible</i> that bad or wrong should flow. On the
contrary, it is the <i>only</i> condition in which love and happiness can go
hand in hand. It is the <i>only</i> practice that can insure continuous
respect, without which love withers and dies out. Can you not see that in
mutual confidence and freedom the very <i>strongest</i> bonds of love are
forged? It is more blessed to grant favors than to demand them, and the
blessing is large and prolific of happiness, or small and insignificant in
results, just in proportion as the favor granted is large or small. Tried by
this rule, the greater the <i>blessing</i> or happiness you can confer on your
partners, in which your own selfish feelings are not consulted, the greater the
satisfaction that will redound to yourself. Think of this mode of adjusting
your difficulties, and see what a clear way opens before you. There are none
who have once felt the influence of a high order of love, so <i>callous</i>, but
that they <i>intuitively</i> recognize the true grandeur and nobility of such a
line of conduct. It must always be remembered that you can never do <i>right</i> until
you are first free to do <i>wrong;</i> since the doing of a thing under <i>compulsion</i>
is evidence <i>neither</i> of good nor bad intent; and if under compulsion,
who shall decide what would be the substituted rule of action under full

advocating Freedom if you can, and I will bear your curse with a better
resignation.

Oh! my brothers and sisters, let me entreat you to have more faith in the
self-regulating efficacy of freedom. Do you not see how beautifully it works
among us in other respects? In America everybody is free to worship God
according to the dictates of his own conscience, or even not to worship
anything, notwithstanding you or I may think that very wicked or wrong. The
respect for freedom we make paramount over our individual opinions, and the
result is peace and harmony, when the people of other countries are still
throttling and destroying each other to enforce their individual opinions on
others. Free Love is only the appreciation of this beautiful principle of
freedom. One step further I entreat you to trust it still, and though you may
see a thousand dangers, I see peace and happiness and steady improvement as the
result.

To more specifically define Free Love I would say that I prefer to use the
word <i>love</i> with <i>lust</i> as its antithesis, <i>love</i> representing
the spiritual and <i>lust</i> the animal; the perfect and harmonious
interrelations of the two being the perfected human. This use has its
justification in other pairs of words; as good and evil; heat and cold; light
and dark; up and down; north and south; which in <i>principle</i> are the same,
but in <i>practice</i> we are obliged to judge of them as <i>relatively</i> different.
The point from which judgment is made is that which we occupy, or are related
to, individually, at any given time. Thus what would be up to one person might
be down to another differently situated, along the line which up and down
described. So also is it of good and evil. What is good to one low down the
ladder may not only be, but actually is, evil to one further ascended;
nevertheless it is the same ladder up which both climb. It is the comprehension
of this scientific fact that guarantees the <i>best</i> religion. And it is the
<i>non-comprehension</i> of it that sets us as judges of our brothers and
sisters, who are below us in the scale of development, to whom we should reach
down the kind and loving hand of assistance, rather than force them to retreat
farther away from us by unkindness, denunciation and hate.

In fine, and to resume: We have found that humanity is composed of men and
women of all grades of developments, from the most hideous human monster up to
the highest perfected saint: that all of them, under our theory of government,
are entitled to worship God after the dictates of their several consciences;
that God is worshiped just as essentially in political and social thought and
action as He is in religious thought and action; that no second person or
persons have any right to interfere with the action of the individual unless he
interfere with others&#8217; rights, and then only to protect such rights; that the
thoughts and actions of all individuals, whether high and pure, or low and
debauched, are equally entitled to the protection of the laws, and, through
them, to that of all members of the community. Religious thought and action
already receive the equal protection of the laws. Political thought and action
are about to secure the equal protection of the laws. What social thought and
action demand of the laws and their administrators is the same protection which
Religion has, and Politics is about to have.

I know full well how strong is the appeal that can be made in behalf of
marriage, an appeal based on the sanctions of usage and inherited respect, and
on the sanctions of religion reinforced by the sanctions of law. I know how
much can be said, and how forcibly it can be said, on the ground that women,
and especially that the children born of the union of the sexes, must be
protected, and must, therefore, have the solemn contract of the husband and
father to that effect. I know how long and how powerfully the ideality and
sentiment of mankind have clustered, as it were in a halo, around this
time-honored institution of marriage. And yet I solemnly believe that <i>all
that</i> belongs to a dispensation of force and contract, and of a law and
unworthy sense of mutual ownership, which is passing, and which is destined
rapidly to pass, completely away; not to leave us without love, nor without
the happiness and beauty of the most tender relation of human souls; nor
without security for woman, and ample protection for children; but to lift us
to a higher level in the enjoyment of every blessing. I believe in <i>love with
liberty</i>; in <i>protection without slavery</i>; in <i>the care and culture
of offspring by new and better methods, and without the tragedy of
self-immolation on the part of parents</i>. I believe in the family, <i>spiritually
constituted</i>, expanded, amplified, and scientifically and artistically
organized, as a unitary home. I believe in the most wonderful transformation of
human society as about to come, as even now at the very door, through general
progress, science and the influential intervention of the spirit world. I
believe in more than all that the millennium has ever signified to the most religious
mind; and I believe that in order to prepare minds to contemplate and desire
and enact the new and better life, it is necessary that the old and still
prevalent superstitious veneration for the legal marriage tie be relaxed and
weakened; not to pander to immorality, but as introductory to a nobler manhood
and a more glorified womanhood; as, indeed, the veritable gateway to a paradise
regained.

Do not criticize me, therefore, from a commonplace point of view. Question
me, first, of the grounds of my faith. Conceive, if you can, the outlook for
that humanity which comes trooping through the long, bright vista of futurity,
as seen by the eyes of a devout spiritualist and a transcendental socialist. My
whole nature is prophetic. I do not and cannot live merely in the present.
Credit, first, the burden of my prophecy; and from the new standing-ground so
projected forth into the future, look back upon our times, and so judge of my
doctrine; and if, still, you cannot concede either the premises or the conclusion,
you may, perhaps, think more kindly of me personally, as an amiable enthusiast,
than if you deemed me deliberately wicked in seeking to disturb the foundations
of our existing social order.

I prize dearly the good opinion of my fellow-beings. I would, <i>so gladly</i>, have
you think well of me, and not ill. It is because I love you all, and love your
well-being still more than I love you, that I tell you my vision of the future,
and that I would willingly disturb your confidence, so long cherished, in the old
dead or dying-out past. Believe me honest, my dear friends, and so forgive and
think of me lovingly in turn, even if you are compelled still to regard me as
deceived. I repeat, that I love you all; that I love every human creature, and
their well being; and that I believe, with the profoundest conviction, that
what I have urged in this discourse is conducive to that end.

Thus have I explained to you what Social Freedom or, as some choose to
denominate it, Free Love, is, and what its advocates demand. Society says, to
grant it is to precipitate itself into anarchy. I oppose to this arbitrary
assumption the logic of general freedom, and aver that order and harmony will
be secured where anarchy now reigns. The order of nature will soon determine
whether society is or I am right. Let that be as it may, I repeat: &#8220;The
love that I cannot command is not mine; let me not disturb myself about it, nor
attempt to filch it from its rightful owner. A heart that I supposed mine has
drifted and gone. Shall I go in pursuit? Shall I forcibly capture the truant
and transfix it with the barb of my selfish affection, and pin it to the wall
of my character? Rather let me leave my doors and windows open, intent only on
living so nobly that the best cannot fail to be drawn to me by an irresistible
attraction.&#8221;

Almost simultaneously with the enunciation of the Principles of Social
Freedom, in other words, the Natural Laws which underlie the Social Relations
of the Sexes, comes the voice of Alfred Tennyson from beyond the seas. <i>Harper's
Weekly</i>, the journal of civilization, gives us his last utterance, &#8220;The
Last Tournament.&#8221; In the Poet Laureate&#8217;s melodious lines we find the
rhythmical echo of those solemn and all-important truths which we had put
forward in ruder but not less earnest prose. That the Harpers should publish
truths in poetry which they denounce in prose does not surprise us. The form
and manner of the utterance make such a difference; the renown of the prophet
insures an audience; publishers are mortal. With them it is not the doctrine,
but its pecuniary acceptableness. Does it pay? But we wait with wonder to see
what the press shall say of this newest proclamation, &#8220;by authority,&#8221;
of self-evident truths. The &#8220;bald and bold&#8221; pronunciamento of
Steinway Hall is overlaid by the subtle refinements and pure elegance of the
most sentimental and most philosophic poet of the age. We are denounced as
wishing to reduce the sexual relation to simple promiscuity, while our faith
and our contention are that perfect freedom would annihilate all temptation to
promiscuity. We denounce promiscuity and licentiousness with all our might, and
shall protest against them to our latest breath. Let Sir Tristam speak for us:

&#8220;Good now, what music have I broken, fool?&#8221; <br>
And little Dagonet, skipping, &#8220;Arthur, the King&#8217;s; <br>
For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt, <br>
Thou makest broken music with thy bride, <br>
Her daintier namesake down in Brittany &#8211; <br>
And so thou breakest Arthur&#8217;s music too.&#8221; <br>
&#8220;Save for that broken music in thy brains, <br>
Sir Fool,&#8221; said Tristam, &#8220;I would break thy head. <br>
Fool, I came late, the heathen wars were o&#8217;er, <br>
The life had flown, we sware but by the shell &#8211; <br>
I am but a fool to reason with a fool &#8211; <br>
Come, thou art crabb&#8217;d and sour; but lean me down, <br>
Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses&#8217; ears, <br>
And hearken if my music be not true. 
<br><br>
<i>&#8221;Free love &#8211; free field &#8211; we love but while we may.<br>
The woods are hush&#8217;d, their music is no more: <br>
The leaf is dead, the yearning past away: <br>
New leaf, new life &#8211; the days of frost are o&#8217;er: <br>
New life, new love to suit the newer day: <br>
New loves are sweet as those that went before: <br>
Free love &#8211; free field &#8211; we love but while we may.</i>
<br><br>
&#8220;Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune, <br>
Not stood stockstill. <i>I made it in the woods, <br>
And found it ring as true as tested gold.&#8221;</i> 
<br><br>
Then Tristam, pacing moodily up and down, <br>
&#8220;Vows! did ye keep the vow ye made to Mark <br>
More than I mine! Lied, say ye? Nay, but learnt, <br>
<i>The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself &#8211; </i> <br>
My knighthood taught me this &#8211; ay, being snapt &#8211;  <br>
<i>We run more counter to the soul thereof <br>
Than had we never sworn</i>. I swear no more. <br>
I swore to the great King, and am forsworn. <br>
For once &#8211; ev&#8217;n to the height &#8211; I honor&#8217;d him. <br>
Man, is he man at all? 
<br><br>
&#8220;He seem'd to me no man, <br>
But Michael trampling Satan; so I sware, <br>
Being amazed: but this went by &#8211; the vows! <br>
O ay &#8211; the wholesome madness of an hour- <br>
They served their use; <br>
<br>
&#8220;But then their vows &#8211; <br>
First mainly thro&#8217; that sallying of our Queen &#8211; <br>
Began to call the knighthood, asking whence 
<br>
Had Arthur right to bind them to himself? <br><br>
To bind them by inviolable vows, <br>
Which flesh and blood perforce would violate: <br><br>
Can Arthur make me pure <br>
As any maiden child? lock up my tongue <br>
From uttering freely what I freely hear? <br>
Bind me to one? The great world laughs at it. <br>
And worldling of the world am I, and know <br>
The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour <br>
Woos his own end; we are not angels here <br>
Nor shall be: vows &#8211; I am woodman of the woods, <br>
And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale <br>
Mock them: my soul, we love but while we may, <br>
And therefore is my love so large for thee, <br>
Seeing it is not bounded save by love.&#8221;
<br><br>
Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said, <br>
&#8220;Good: an I turn&#8217;d away my love for thee <br>
To some one thrice as courteous as thyself &#8211; <br>
For courtesy wins woman all as well <br>
As valor may &#8211; but he that closes both <br>
Is perfect, he is Lancelot &#8211; taller indeed, <br>
Roster and comelier, thou &#8211; but say I loved <br>
This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back <br>
Thine own small saw, We love but while we may, <br>
Well, then, what answer?&#8221;
<br><br>
He that while she spake <br>
Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with, <br>
The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch <br>
The warm white apple of her throat, replied, <br>
&#8220;Press this a little closer, sweet, until &#8211;  <br>
Come, I am hunger&#8217;d and half anger&#8217;d &#8211; meat, <br>
Wine, wine &#8211; and I will love thee to the death, <br>
And out beyond into the dream to come.&#8221;
<br><br>
So then, when both were brought to full accord, <br>
She rose, and set before him all he will&#8217;d; <br>
And after these had comforted the blood <br>
With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts &#8211;  <br>
Now talking of their woodland paradise, <br>
The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns; <br>
Now mocking at the much ungainliness, <br>
And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark &#8211; <br>
Then Tristam laughing caught the harp, and sang: 
<br><br>
<blockquote><font size="-1">
&#8220;Ay, ay, O ay &#8211; the winds that bend the brier! <br>
A star in heaven, a star within the mere! <br>
Ay, ay, O ay &#8211; a star was my desire; <br>
And one was far apart, and one was near: <br>
Ay, ay, O ay &#8211; the winds that bow the grass! <br>
And one was water and one star was fire, <br>
And one will ever shine and one will pass &#8211;  <br>
Ay, ay, O ay &#8211; the winds that move the mere.&#8221;
