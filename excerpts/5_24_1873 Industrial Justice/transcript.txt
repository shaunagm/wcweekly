1 Go to, now, ye rich men; weep and how, for your miscries that shall come upon you.
4. Behold the hire of the labors who have reaped down your fields , which is kept back by fraud,crieth, and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the cars of the Lord. Gel. Ep. James v. 1-4

THE AMERICAN LABOR REFORM LEAGUE
The third annual convention of the American Labor Reform League met Sunday, May 4th, at the Masonic Hall, on Thirteenth street, near Third avenue. At the morning session, the meeting was called to order E.H. Heywood, Secretary, who introduced L.K Joslin, Vice President, from Rhode Island. At the afternoon session, a paper was read by Louis Masquiner, of Brooklyn, on "Labor Reform,"  and the subsequent discussion was taking part in by Dr. C.S. Weeks, John H.Kiser, Dr. Shevlin, M. D. Buckli and Dr. Sheppard. They held that beyond the necessaries of life the accumulation of the property is a wrong, and a man who gathers wealth robs his fellow-men. r Bucklin said that when a man is worth $20,000,000 it is better for the community for him to be in State Prison than out of it.
